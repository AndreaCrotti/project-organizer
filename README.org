Project organizer

This project aims to set up an uniform way to manage multiple
projects, trying to support many different SCMs and modalities.


* TODO take from mr.developer or write from scratch some code to abstract the SCM used

* TODO define a grammar/syntax for a configuration file format

* TODO write doc in RST format

Every project can be a separate entity, but sharing configurations and
general rules with many other projects.

In case there is an original project of our personal fork, we should
be able to see detailed diffs and statistics about it.

* Emacs integration
  Switching to project should be done withing Emacs (calling shell
  commands) too with the following:
  - always store buffers and window configurations used
  - restore buffers (maybe in new frames) and window configurations
  - show and analyse the time spent in each of the projects
    (possibly using org-mode and its advanced timing mechanisms)
