Project organizer

This project aims to set up an uniform way to manage multiple
projects, trying to support many different SCMs and modalities.


* TODO take from mr.developer or write from scratch some code to abstract the SCM used

* TODO define a grammar/syntax for a configuration file format

* TODO write doc in RST format

Every project can be a separate entity, but sharing configurations and
general rules with many other projects.

* Emacs integration
  Switching to project should be done withing Emacs (calling shell
  commands) too with the following:
  - always store buffers and window configurations used
  - restore buffers (maybe in new frames) and window configurations
  - show and analyse the time spent in each of the projects
    (possibly using org-mode and its advanced timing mechanisms)
